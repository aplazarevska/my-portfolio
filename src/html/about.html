            <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Ana Lazarevska and as you can see I am a bit obsessed by all aspects of tea. I started brewing tea quite recently, in 2013, but I can say that now I'm an expert.</p><br>
            <p>My other recent obsession is coding. I started ‘brewing’ code in 2021 when I enrolled in Coder Academy in Sydney. I want to become an expert in this field as well, and to build my professional career around it.</p><br>
            <p>Otherwise, I have been working and studying different things in my life, often quite unrelated. I do have broad area of interests after all. I was working as translator while studying archaeology and art history at faculty. When I moved to Australia I started studying ancient history at faculty while raising my son. History is another passion of mine that I never want to let go of. In meantime I got Diploma in Accounting, but I could not see myself working in that field. While I love the art of accounting, working professionally in the accounting field did not suit my personality and my lifestyle, and it did not excite me. </p><br>
            <p>I have always been good with technology, ever since I got my first computer (while I don’t remember the model, I remember it used those 5 1/4-inch floppy disks). But due to the fact that I was so much interested in the past, I never considered exploring the futuristic field of computers in a greater detail. Coding drew my attention few years ago, and while the interest was growing in me, I started considering to making a career out of it only in 2020. I like to sit and solve logical puzzles for hours, and coding to me is something very similar. It is also a field that allows me to keep my individuality, while in the same time connecting me to varied types of people. Coding has everything, and I want to be one of the people who call themselves ‘coder’.</p><br>
